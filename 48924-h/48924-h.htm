  CANAL</span></h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE idea of going to Panama to make lithographs of the Canal
was mine. I suggested it, and the <i>Century Magazine</i> and <i>Illustrated
London News</i> offered to print some of the drawings I might
make.</p>

<p>Though I suggested the scheme a couple of years ago, it was not
until January, 1912, that I was able to go&mdash;and then I was afraid
it was too late&mdash;afraid the work was finished and that there would
be nothing to see, for photographs taken a year or eighteen months
before, showed some of the locks built and their gates partly in place.</p>

<p>Still I started, and after nearly three weeks of voyaging found,
one January morning, the Isthmus of Panama ahead of the steamer,
a mountainous country, showing deep valleys filled with mist, like
snow fields, as I have often seen them from Montepulciano looking
over Lake Thrasymene, in Italy. Beyond were higher peaks,
strange yet familiar, Japanese prints, and as we came into the
harbor the near hills and distant mountains were silhouetted with
Japanese trees and even the houses were Japanese, and when we
at length landed, the town was full of character reminiscent of Spain,
yet the local character came out in the Cathedral, the tower of which&mdash;a
pyramid&mdash;was covered with a shimmering, glittering mosaic of
pearl oyster shells. The people, not Americans, were primitive, and
the children, mostly as in Spain, were not bothered with clothes.</p>

<p>I followed my instinct, which took me at once to the great
swamp near the town of Mount Hope, where so many of De Lesseps'
plans lie buried. Here are locomotives, dredges, lock-gates, huge
bulks of iron, great wheels, nameless, shapeless masses&mdash;half under
water, half covered with vines&mdash;the end of a great work. I came
back to Colon by the side of the French Canal, completed and
working up to, I believe, Gatun Lock and Dam, and spent the afternoon
in the American town, every house Japanese in feeling, French
or American in construction, screened with black wire gauze, divided
by white wood lines&mdash;most decorative&mdash;and all shaded by a forest of
palms. Through these wandered well-made roads, and on them were
walking and driving well-made Americans. There were no mosquitoes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
no flies, no smells, none of the usual adjuncts of a tropical town.</p>

<p>At the end of the town was a monument, a nondescript
Columbus, facing nowhere, at his feet an Indian; but it seemed to
me, if any monument was wanted at Colon, it should be a great
light-house or a great statue towering aloft in the harbor, a memorial
to the men who, French and American, have made the Canal.</p>

<p>Next day I started across the Continent to Panama, for I learned
the Government headquarters were there, and, until I had seen the
officials, I did not know if I should be allowed to work or even stay
on the Isthmus. But at Gatun I got off the train, determining to do
all I could before I was stopped&mdash;as I was quite sure I should be. I
saw the tops of the locks only a few hundred yards away, and, turning
my back on the stunning town piled up on the hillside, walked
over to them; from a bridge bearing a sign that all who used it did
so at their own risk I looked down into a yawning gulf stretching
to right and left, the bottom filled with crowds of tiny men and tiny
trains&mdash;all in a maze of work; to the right the gulf reached to a
lake, to the left to mighty gates which mounted from the bottom to
my feet. Overhead, huge iron buckets flew to and fro, great cranes
raised or lowered huge masses of material. As I looked, a bell rang,
the men dropped their tools, and lines of little figures marched away,
or climbed wooden stairs and iron ladders to the surface. The engines
whistled, the buckets paused, everything stopped instantly, save that
from the depths a long chain came quickly up, and clinging to the
end of it, as Cellini would have grouped them, were a dozen men&mdash;a
living design&mdash;the most decorative motive I have ever seen in the
Wonder of Work. I could not have imagined it, and in all the time
I was on the Isthmus I never saw it but once again. For a second
only they were posed, and then the huge crane swung the group to
ground and the design fell to pieces as they dropped off.</p>

<p>Across the bridge was a telephone station and beyond and below
it the great approaches to the locks along which electric locomotives
will draw the ships that pass through. There was a subject,
and I tackled it at once. In the distance the already filling lake&mdash;among
islands, but the highland still above the water, dotting it,
crowned with palms and strange trees; dredgers slowly moved, native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
canoes paddled rapidly, over all hovered great birds. To the right
was the long line of the French Canal, almost submerged, stretching
to the distance, against which, blue and misty and flat, were
strange-shaped mountains, outlined with strange-shaped trees.
Bridges like those of Hiroshigi connected island with island or with
the mainland. It was perfect, the apotheosis of the Wonder of Work,
and as I looked the whole rocked as with an earthquake&mdash;and then
another. I was dragged into the hut as showers of stones rattled
on the roof as blast after blast went off near by. Soon people in
authority came up&mdash;I supposed to stop me; instead it was only to show
pleasure that I found their work worth drawing. These men were all
Americans, all so proud of their part in the Canal, and so strong and
healthy&mdash;most of them trained and educated, I knew as soon as they
opened their mouths&mdash;the greatest contrast to the crowd on the
steamer, who now were all tamely following a guide and listening to
what they could neither understand nor see during their only day
ashore. These engineers and workmen are the sort of Americans
worth knowing, and yet I did not see any golf links at Gatun. The
day was spent in that telephone box and on the Spillway of the Dam&mdash;a
semicircle of cyclopean concrete, backed by a bridge finer than
Hokusai ever imagined, yet built to carry the huge engines that drag
the long trains of dirt and rock across it, to make the dam. The dam,
to me, was too big and too vague to draw. And all this is the work
of my countrymen, and they are so proud of their work. Yet the
men who have done this great work will tell you that we owe much
to the French, and that if the engineers and the Commission at
Panama had not the Government, with unlimited men and money,
behind them, and the discoveries in sanitary science of which the
French were ignorant, we, too, would have failed. They tell you,
and show you how, the French worked on the Canal right across the
Isthmus, and we are carrying out the great project they were unable
to complete. And we have won the admiration of the world.</p>

<p>The sanitary problem is solved, but they tell you under the
French, fever carried off a man for every tie that was laid on the
Panama Railroad. This is a legend, but a true story is, that the
French cared so little for their lives that with every shipload of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
machinery came boxes of champagne, and those who received them
asked their friends to dinner&mdash;finished the bottles&mdash;and were buried
in the empty box in the morning. Now there is no fever in the
Canal Zone, but there is plenty of drink in and outside of it, but, I
am told, "indulged in with wonderful moderation." I certainly
never saw an American under the influence of it.</p>

<p>In the evening a ride of two hours took me over the thirty
miles to Panama&mdash;one of the last passengers over the old line of the
Panama Railway, now buried under the waters of the growing lake.
From the railroad I saw for the first time the primeval forest, the
tropical jungle, which I had never believed in, never believed that it
could not be penetrated save with an axe or a machete; but it is so,
and the richness of it, the riot of it, the variety of it, is incredible and
endless. The train puffed along, in that time-taking fashion of the
tropics I should soon be familiar with, passing points of view I
made notes of, for first impressions are for me always the best,
and one trip like this gives me more ideas than days of personal
pointing out. Finally Panama was reached in the dark; all I saw
was a great hill lit up with rows of lights, one above the other, in
the night.</p>

<p>The day had not been hot, the sky was not blue or black&mdash;it was
white, and filled with white clouds, though they were dark against it.
There was no glare&mdash;and I had forgotten my sketching umbrella; but
I never needed it. So far as I know, there is always a breeze&mdash;it is
never really hot in the day&mdash;and as soon as the sun sets the trade
wind rises&mdash;if it has not been blowing all day&mdash;and I could always
sleep at night. It is all so unlike other hot countries&mdash;but, then,
Panama is unlike other places: the sun rises and sets in the Pacific,
and the city of Panama, though on the Pacific, is east of Colon, on
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>There was not a smell, or a mosquito, or a fly on Ancon Hill,
but over it all was the odor of petroleum, with which the streams
and marshes of the whole zone are sprayed almost daily; and this
has made the Canal and saved the workers.</p>

<p>Next morning I went to the Administration Building and presented
my letters, though I did not know if I should be allowed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
draw. But it seemed that everything had been arranged for me by
the Commission, who, it also seemed, had been doing nothing for
weeks but waiting my coming. I was clothed, fed, taken about in
motor cars and steam launches, given passes on the railroad, and
finally turned loose to go where I wanted and draw what I liked&mdash;and
if anything happened or did not happen I was just to telephone
to headquarters.</p>

<p>The following day, donning my khaki, which I wore only once,
and pocketing my pass and some oranges, I started for the locks at
Pedro Miguel&mdash;pronounced, in American, Peter Megil, just as
Miraflores is called Millflowers. We were all down, had breakfast,
and off in the train&mdash;a jim-crow one&mdash;before the sun was up, and at
Pedro Miguel station I found myself one of a horde of niggers, Greeks,
Hindoos, Slovaks, Spaniards, Americans and engineers, bound for
the lock, half a mile away. Here I went down to the bottom to get
a drawing of the great walls that lead up to the great gates, now
nearly finished. I had come at exactly the right time. These walls
are surmounted with great arches and buttresses&mdash;the most decorative
subject, the most stupendous motive I have ever seen&mdash;almost
too great to draw. Unlike my experiences of a lifetime at
other Government works, I was asked for no permit. I was allowed
to go where I wanted, draw what I liked; when any attention was paid
to me, it was to ask what I was working for&mdash;give me a glass of ice
water&mdash;precious, out of the breeze at the bottom of a lock&mdash;offer to
get me a photograph or make one, to suggest points of view, or
tell me to clear out when a blast was to be fired. And the interest of
these Americans in my work and in their work was something I
had never seen before. A man in huge boots, overalls and ragged
shirt, an apology for a hat, his sleeves up to his shoulders, proved
himself in a minute a graduate of a great school of engineering, and
proved as well his understanding of the importance of the work I
was trying to do, and his regret that most painters could not see the
splendid motives all about; and the greatest compliment I ever received
came from one of these men, who told me my drawings
"would work."</p>

<p>Day after day it was the same&mdash;everything, including government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
hotels and labor trains, open to me. The only things to look out for
were the blasts, the slips of dirt in the cut, and the trains, which
rushed and switched about without any reference to those who might
get in front of them. If one got run over, as was not usual; or
blown up, which was unusual; or malaria, which few escaped
among the workmen, there were plenty of hospitals, lots of nurses
and sufficient doctors. Each railroad switch was attended by a little
darkey with a big flag; of one of whom it was said he was seen to be
asleep, with his head on the rails one day. The engineer of an
approaching dirt train actually pulled up, and he was kicked awake
and asked why he was taking a nap there. The boy replied he was
"'termined no train go by, boss, widout me knowin' it"; and of
another who, awaking suddenly and seeing half a train past his
switch, pulled it open and wrecked all the trains, tracks and switches
within a quarter of a mile; or the third, a Jamaican, a new hand,
who, being told he was not to let a train go by, promptly signalled
a locomotive to come on, and when he was hauled up, smilingly said:
"Dat wan't no train wat yer tole me to stop; dat's a enjine."</p>

<p>Drawing had other interesting episodes connected with it, as
when I sat at work in Culebra Cut the leading man of a file of niggers,
carrying on his head a wooden box, would approach, stop beside
me and look at the drawing. As I happened to look up I would notice
the box was labelled, <i>Explosives, Highly dangerous</i>. Then, with his
hands in his pockets, he and the rest of the gang would stumble along
over the half-laid ties, slippery boulders and through the mud, trying
to avoid the endless trains and balance the boxes on their heads at the
same time. I must say, when I read the legend on the box the sensation
was peculiar. They tell you, too, that when President Taft
came down to the Cut all dynamiting gangs were ordered out; but
one gang of blacks was forgotten, and as the train with the President
and Colonel Goethals in it passed, the leader cheered so hard that he
dropped his box, which somehow didn't go off. It was interesting,
too, when one had been working steadily for some time, to find oneself
surrounded, on getting up, by little flags, to announce that the
whole place had been mined and should not be approached; or to
find oneself entangled in a network of live wires ready to touch off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the blasts from hundreds of yards away, and to remember that I was
behind a boulder about to be blown to pieces, and might be overlooked;
or to be told I had better get out, as they were ready to blast,
after a white man had got done chucking from one rock, to a black
man on another, sticks of melanite, as the easiest way of getting them
to him; or ramming in, with long poles, charges so big that trains, steam
shovels and tracks had to be moved to keep them from being "shot
up." I always kept out of the way as far as possible after the
day at Bas Obispo when, standing some hundreds of yards from
a blast watching the effect of showers of rocks falling like shells in
the river, I heard wild yells, and, looking up, saw a rock as big as a
foot-ball sailing toward me. I have heard one can see shells coming
and dodge them. I know now that this is so, though I had to drop
everything and roll to do it. But I don't like it; and accidents do
happen, and there are hospitals all across the Isthmus with men, to
whom accidents have happened, in them. But nothing happened
to me. I did not get malaria or fever, or bitten or run over. I was
very well all the time&mdash;and I walked in the sun and worked in the
sun, and sat in the swamps and the bottoms of locks and at the edge
of the dam, and nothing but drawings happened; but I should not
advise others to try these things, nor to get too near steam shovels,
which "pick up anything, from an elephant to a red-bug," but sometimes
drop a ton rock; nor play around near track-lifters and dirt-train
emptiers&mdash;for the things are small respecters of persons. But
most people do not get hurt, and I never met anyone who wanted
to leave; and I believe the threat to send the men home broke the
only strike on the Canal.</p>

<p>I did not go to Panama to study engineering&mdash;which I know
nothing about; or social problems&mdash;which I had not time to master;
or Central American politics&mdash;which we are in for; but to draw the
Canal as it is, and the drawings are done.</p>

<p>I was there at the psychological moment, and am glad I went.
It is not my business to answer the question: When will the Canal
be opened?&mdash;though they say it will be open within a year.</p>

<p>Will the dam stand? Those who have built it say so.</p>

<p>Which is better, a sea level or a lock? The lock canal is built.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not bother myself about these things, nor about lengths
and breadths and heights and depths. I went to see and draw the
Canal, and during all the time I was there I was afforded every
facility for seeing the construction of the Panama Canal, and from
my point of view it is the most wonderful thing in the world; and I
have tried to express this in my drawings at the moment before it
was opened, for when it is opened, and the water turned in, half
the amazing masses of masonry will be beneath the waters on one
side and filled in with earth on the other, and the picturesqueness will
have vanished. The Culebra Cut will be finer, and from great
steamers passing through the gorge, worth going 15,000 miles, as I
have done, to see. But I saw it at the right time, and have tried to
show what I saw. And it is American&mdash;the work of my countrymen.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE city of Colon is divided into two quarters&mdash;the
native, or Panamanian, and the American. The former
is picturesque, but has nothing to do with the Canal and is
some distance from it. The Canal cannot be seen from the
city. The American quarter, in which the Canal employees
live, stands on the sea shore, and is made up of bungalows,
shops, hotels, hospitals&mdash;all that goes to make up a city&mdash;save
saloons. All are built of wood, painted white, and completely
screened with wire gauze, rusted black by the dampness,
a protection from mosquitoes and other beasts, bugs
and vermin. Raised on concrete supports mostly with long,
gently sloping roofs, and buried in a forest of palms, the
town, the first the visitor will see, seems absolutely Japanese,
is very pictorial and full of character. The design,
I believe, of the houses was made by the American engineers
or architects.</p>

<p>Very few of the higher Canal officers live at Colon, which
is the Atlantic seaport of the Isthmus, the eastern mouth
of the Canal, though Colon is west of Panama&mdash;such is the
geography of the country.</p>

<p>The mouth of the Canal will be fortified; breakwaters
and light-houses are being built.</p>

<p>For authorities on fortification it may be interesting to
state that the forts will be so situated that the locks will be
completely out of range of an enemy's guns. Personally I
am not a believer in wars or navies. If my theories were
practised there would be no need for fortifications.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NEAR Mount Hope, which&mdash;for the French&mdash;should be
called the Slough of Despond, or the Lake of Despair,
is a huge swamp about a mile or so from Colon, on the left
bank of the French Canal, seen on the right of the lithograph.
This swamp is now filled with all sorts of abandoned
French machinery. Dredges, locomotives, and even
what seem to be lock gates, show amid the palms in the
distance. Huge American cranes for raising this French
material&mdash;which the American engineers have made use
of&mdash;and discharging cargo from the ships in the French
Canal&mdash;which is here finished and in use&mdash;loom over the
swamp, the banks of which are lined with piers and
workshops full of life&mdash;a curious contrast to the dead swamp
in which not a mosquito lives, nor a smell breathes.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BETWEEN Mount Hope and Gatun is much more of
the swamp and much more abandoned machinery, but
the Canal is not to be seen from the railroad, or any evidence
of it, till the train stops at the station of Old Gatun, with
its workmen's dwellings crowning the hillside. I regret I
made no drawing of these, so picturesquely perched. At
the station of Gatun&mdash;the first time I stopped&mdash;I saw the
workmen&mdash;in decorative fashion&mdash;coming to the surface
for dinner. The lithograph was made from a temporary
bridge spanning the locks and looking toward Colon. The
great machines on each side of the locks are for mixing
and carrying to their place, in huge buckets, the cement
and concrete, of which the locks are built. The French
Canal is in the extreme distance, now used by our engineers.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THERE is a flight of three double locks at Gatun by which
ships will be raised eighty-five feet to the level of Gatun
Lake. From the gates of the upper lock&mdash;the nearest to
the Pacific&mdash;they will sail across the now-forming lake
some miles (about twenty, I believe) to the Culebra Cut;
through this, nine miles long, they will pass, and then descend
by three other flights of locks, at Pedro Miguel and
Miraflores, to the Pacific, which is twenty feet higher, I believe,
than the Atlantic. The great height, eighty-five feet,
was agreed upon so as to save excavation in the Cut and
time in completion&mdash;one of those magnificent labor-saving
devices of the moment&mdash;which I, not being an engineer, see
no necessity for&mdash;having waited four hundred years for the
Canal, we might, as an outsider, it seems to me, have
waited four more years and got rid of a number of the locks,
even if it cost more money.</p>

<p>The lithograph made in the middle lock shows the gates
towering on either side. These gates were covered, when
I made the drawing, with their armor plates. The lower
parts, I was told, are to be filled with air, and the gates,
worked by electricity, will virtually float. The scaffolding is
only temporary, and so is the opening at the bottom and the
railroad tracks, which were filled up and discarded while I
was there. So huge are the locks&mdash;the three, I think, a mile
long, each one thousand feet between the gates, and about
ninety feet deep&mdash;that, until the men knock off, there scarce
seems anyone around.</p>

of accident, the main lock gate, just suggested, with
the figures working at the armor-plate facing, on the extreme
right. Beyond are the outer walls and approaches
of the upper lock, and beyond these, but unseen, the lake.
At the bottom is the railroad and the temporary opening
shown in the previous drawing. The scale, the immensity
of the whole may be judged by the size of the engines and
figures. I have never seen such a magnificent arrangement
of line, light and mass, and yet those were the last things
the engineers thought of. But great work is great art, and
always was and will be. This is the Wonder of Work.</p>

and to break the waves of the lake, are mightier
than any Roman aqueduct, and more pictorial, yet soon they
will be hidden almost to the top by the waters of the lake.
Electric locomotives will run out to the farthest point, and
from it, tow the ships into the lock. Beyond is Gatun Lake,
and to the right the lines of the French Canal and Chagres
River stretch to the horizon. Even while I was on the
Isthmus the river and canal disappeared forever before the
waters of the rapidly rising flood. All evidence of the
French work beyond Gatun has vanished under water. I
did not draw the Dam or the Spillway simply because I
could not find a subject to draw, or could not draw it.</p>

to the visitor primitive Panama, its swamps,
jungles and native villages; but, owing to Colonel Gorgas,
native no longer, as they are odorless and clean; but the
natives, with their transformation, seem to prefer to the palm-leaf
roof, corrugated iron and tin, and abandoned freight
cars to live in. The huts are mostly built on piles near the
rivers. In the background can be seen the strange-shaped
mountains and strange-shaped trees. The white tree&mdash;I
don't know its name&mdash;with the bushy top has no bark,
and is not dead, but puts out leaves, Mrs. Colonel Gaillard
tells me, in summer; and she also tells me the jungle is full
of the most wonderful orchids, birds, snakes, monkeys and
natives, and offered to take me to see them. I saw her
splendid collection of orchids at Culebra, through the
luxuriance of which Colonel Gaillard says he has to hew his
way with a machete every morning to breakfast, so fast do
plants grow on the Isthmus. Advantage of this rapidity of
jungle growth has been taken to bind together the completed
parts of the surface of the dam, which are covered
with so much vegetation that I could not tell Nature's work
from that of the engineers.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THESE are scattered all across the Continent, hemmed in
by the tropical jungle or placed on the high, cool
hill. In all there is, first, the news-stand at the station;
then, the hotel&mdash;really restaurants&mdash;where on one side the
Americans "gold employees" dine for thirty cents, better than
they could for a dollar at home&mdash;and more decently; men,
women and children. On the other, in a separate building,
usually, the "silver employees" foreigners; and there are
separate dining and sleeping places and cars for negroes,
even on workmen's trains. The Indian has the sense
and pride to live his own life down there, apart, as at
home in India. There are many in the Zone.</p>

<p>The head men in each of these towns have their own
houses; the lesser lights share double ones; and I believe
the least of all, bunks; but these matters didn't interest
me, nor did sanitary conditions or social evils or advantages.</p>

<p>There are also clubs, I believe, social centres, mothers'
meetings, churches, art galleries and museums on the
Isthmus, but I never saw them. I was after picturesqueness.
Still, it is no wonder, under present conditions, that I
never found a man who wanted to "go home"&mdash;and some
hadn't been home for seven years, and dreaded going&mdash;and
rightly. The Canal Zone is the best governed section
of the United States.</p>

building and construction, from my point of view.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS was drawn from the opposite end of the lock and
the great side walls topped with their concrete-making
crenellations and cranes are seen. In the foreground, on
the left, is one of the side openings for emptying the water
from one lock to another&mdash;for all the locks are double, side
by side, and ships will not have to wait until a lock is empty,
as is usual, before they can enter, but, as one empties, the
same water partly fills the one beside it, and so steamers will
pass without waiting. Two or three small vessels can go
through at the same time, as well as the largest with room
to spare.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS lock, the nearest the Pacific, is again quite different
and is the work of a civil engineer, Mr. Williamson,
and not of army officers, like the rest. Between the two
forces, I believe, the most fierce harmony exists. The drawing
shows the two locks side by side, the great cranes&mdash;they
are different, too&mdash;towering above. All the ground here
will be filled by a small lake between this lock and Pedro
Miguel.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THESE great cranes travel to and fro, and as I drew the
nearest I found the lines changing, but thought there
was something wrong with me. So huge were they, and so
silently and solemnly did they move, that I could not believe
they were moving. This is the Pacific end of the lock&mdash;the
last on the Canal.</p>

Mr. Williamson, had no doubt it would be finished this
fall; for as fast as the other locks were completed, men
and machines were to be put on this.</p>

help while on the Zone.</p>

<p>Ancon is a perfect Japanese town&mdash;built by Americans&mdash;and
the interiors of the houses here and at Culebra are
as delightful as their owners are charming&mdash;and I know of
what I speak. The large building against the ocean is the
Administration Office of the Isthmian Canal Commission.</p>

  THE CITY OF PANAMA FROM THE TIVOLI HOTEL, ANCON</span></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_f.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">FROM the wing of the Government hotel in which I
stayed I looked out over the city of Panama to the Pacific.
If this city were in Spain, or if even a decent description
of it were in a European guide-book, the hordes of Americans
who go to the Canal would rave over it. As it is, not
many of them (not being told) ever see it, though there
are few towns in Europe with more character. But I
regret to say my countrymen don't know what they are
looking at, or what to look at, till they have a guide-book,
courier or tout to tell them. The Government provides,
I am told, a Harvard graduate to perform the latter
function, and sends out daily an observation car across the
Continent.</p>

<p>The two strange, flat-topped mountains, miles out at sea,
are to be fortified, and they are so far from shore, and
the locks so far inland, as to be out of range&mdash;as well as out
of sight&mdash;of modern guns and gunners.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THIS drawing was made from the channel which leads
out to the Pacific Ocean. The mouth of the Canal is
on the left in the flat space between the mountains; on the
right of this, the dark mass on the edge of the water is the
docks and harbors; then comes the great, towering Ancon
Hill, one side all dug out in terraces for dirt, much of which
goes to fill in the outside of locks, which, however, will work
before they are filled in. And for what other purposes the
War Department are going to use this Gibraltar they alone
know. The other side, a mass of palms shelters the houses
of the officials, and at the foot of the hill, to the right, Panama&mdash;as
beautiful as Naples or Tangier, yet hardly a tourist
knows it; and&mdash;well, the Government is not running a tourist
agency.</p>

<p>The breakwater, which will connect the fortified islands
miles away with the mainland, is just started in the centre.
This is the first and last view of Panama&mdash;and of the greatest
work of modern times, the work of the greatest engineers
of all time.</p>
